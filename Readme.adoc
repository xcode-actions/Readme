= Xcode Actions
Fran√ßois Lamboley <francois.lamboley@frostland.fr>

You will find here a library of projects to help you setup CI/CD of your Xcode
projects.


== Philosophy

All the tools provided in this repository are in Swift. This is a design choice:

- We think Swift is awesome, and we can do anything with it! Including scripts
and anything needed for a CI pipeline;
- Developers using Xcode are probably used to Swift. Tinkering w/ the tools they
use will be easier if they are written in a language they are used to.

All tools are available using three forms:

- As a simple executable;
- As an Xcode Action;
- As a function that can be called in a Swift package, or even a Swift script
using https://github.com/mxcl/swift-sh[`swift-sh`] or similar.
